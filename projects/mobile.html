        <h1> Real-Time Incident Reporting Mobile Application - Ongoing</h1>
    </div>
</section>

<section class="project-content">
    <p> This project involves the development of a civic-tech mobile application designed to enable members of the public to report real-time incidents
        such as crime, floods, road accidents, and infrastructure hazards. The application was motivated by the need for faster, more transparent, more accessible reporting
        mechanisms in urban environments such as Nairobi.
    </p>
    <p> In many parts of Kenya, delays in emergency response and limited public access to reliable incident data reduce community safety and preparedness. This application seeks to bridge that gap by
        providing a simple platform through which citizens can submit geo-referenced incident reports, supporting improved situational awareness for both public and relevant response agencies.
    </p>
