<section class="project-content">
    <p>This project investigated land cover change and desertification trends in the Chalbi Desert, northern Kenya, as part of a broader environmental research study. The objective was 
        to assess vegetation cover, soil texture and moisture presence in order to understand environmental conditions prior to fieldwork and to establish a baseline for long-term desertification monitoring.
    </p>
    <p> To assess long-term trends, I generated environmental index and land cover maps for four time periods between 1990 and 2020. Visual inspection of these outputs indicated a clear expansion of arid and sparsely vegeted
         areas over time, suggesting progressive desertification across parts of Chalbi region.
    </p>

    <h2> Methodology</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Collected multi-temporal Landsat imagery for selected years between 1990 and 2020</li>
        <li>Computed MSAVI, Soil texture and Soil Moisture indices</li>
        <li>Generated environmental index maps for each time period</li>
        <li>Performed visual and qualitative change detection to assess desert expansion</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tools Used</h2>
    <ul class="tools-used">
        <li>Google Earth Engine</li>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Landsat 5, 7 and 8</li>
    </ul>
